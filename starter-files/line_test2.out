LINE Is Not an Editor -- it is a linear visualization of a TextBuffer.
The '<' character mimics a call to backward()
The '>' character mimics a call to forward()
The '#' character mimics a call to remove()
The '^' character mimics a call to up()
The '!' character mimics a call to down()
The '[' character mimics a call to move_to_row_start()
The ']' character mimics a call to move_to_row_end()
The '@' character mimics a call to insert() with a newline
All other characters just mimic insert() with that character
